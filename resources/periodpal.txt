HOW TO MAKE REUSABLE PADS USING CLOTH OR SAFE MATERIALS
When you can't afford to buy pads every month, you don't have to suffer in silence. You can make your own reusable pads using clean, safe materials just make sure they're soft, absorbent, and comfortable.

🧵 MATERIALS YOU WILL NEED:
- Clean cotton fabric (from old T-shirts, bedsheets, or wrappers)
- Towel material or thick cotton cloth (for the absorbent middle layer)
- Needle and thread or sewing machine
- Scissors
- Press buttons, snaps, or safety pins
- Optional: waterproof material like nylon or plastic from raincoats

✂️ STEPS TO MAKE YOUR REUSABLE PAD

1. Draw and Cut the Shape
- Place a pad or folded cloth on paper and trace its shape
- Cut two identical pieces from cotton fabric (top and bottom layers)
- Cut one or two pieces from towel material (middle absorption layer)

2. Layer It Up
- Bottom cotton layer
- Absorbent layers (towel material) in the middle
- Top cotton layer
- Optional: waterproof material beneath bottom layer

3. Sew the Edges
- Stitch all around edges tightly so layers stay together
- Add wings if desired for security on underwear

4. Dry and Care
- Dry under direct sunlight in a clean, airy place
- Store in a dry, clean bag or container until next use
- One reusable pad can last 2-3 years with proper care

🌼 HOW TO SURVIVE MENSTRUATION WHEN YOU HAVE NO SANITARY PRODUCT

Menstrual Poverty Tips

Menstrual poverty is real – but you can still manage safely and cleanly.

🩸 1. Use Clean Cloth
- Find clean, soft cotton cloth (old wrappers, shirts, baby cloths)
- Wash thoroughly with soap and dry in sunlight
- Fold into thick layers to absorb blood
- Place in underwear and change every 3-4 hours
- Wash after each use; reuse only if clean and dry
⚠️ Never use dirty rags or wet cloth – risk of infection

🌿 2. Keep Clean Always
- Bathe at least once daily during period
- Wash private area with clean water (avoid strong soap)
- Always change cloth/pad regularly
- Wrap used pads safely or bury them; don't flush

👧🏽‍♀️ 3. Wear Comfortable Clothes
- Loose and breathable clothes allow air circulation
- Tight clothing causes irritation and odor

💧 4. Stay Hydrated and Eat Well
- Periods make you weak or dizzy, especially heavy bleeding
- Drink lots of water
- Eat iron-rich foods: beans, spinach, meat, fish, vegetables
- Avoid skipping meals

💬 5. Talk and Seek Support
- Talk to trusted person: teacher, health worker, youth leader
- Many schools and NGOs run pad donation programs
- There is no shame in asking for help
- Periods are natural; silence and stigma are not

🌊 6. If You're in a Place With No Water
- Use clean dry cloth and change often
- Wash used cloth when you get water later
- Dry cloth well before next use
- Always keep extra cloth/pad in your bag

💪 FINAL WORD

Periods should never stop any girl from living her life. Whether store-bought pads or homemade cloth pads, what matters most is cleanliness, comfort, and confidence.

Every girl has the right to menstrual dignity.

PERIOD DELAY 101

🌸 WHY MENSTRUATION SOMETIMES COMES LATE

Your menstrual cycle isn't a robot—it's more like a rhythm your body dances to. Sometimes the rhythm changes, and that's okay.

🌦️ 1. Stress (Emotional or Physical)
When you're worried, anxious, or overwhelmed, your body produces cortisol (stress hormone).
Cortisol can confuse the hypothalamus (the part controlling your period), delaying ovulation.
Example: During exam week or after conflict, your body might delay menstruation.

🥗 2. Poor Nutrition or Sudden Weight Changes
Your body needs energy and nutrients for a healthy cycle.
Sudden weight loss/gain, skipping meals, or eating too little signals "famine mode."
Your body may delay menstruation to conserve energy.
Example: Crash diets or skipping meals throw hormones off balance.

🏃‍♀️ 3. Excessive Exercise
Exercise is amazing—but too much without rest or food can stop your period.
Your body uses most energy to repair muscles instead of maintaining reproductive cycle.
Called Amenorrhea; reversible when body gets rest and food.

⚖️ 4. Hormonal Imbalances (Especially PCOS)
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome makes your body produce extra male hormones (testosterone).
This affects ovulation and makes periods come late or not at all.
Signs: Irregular periods, acne, extra body hair, weight gain around tummy.
It can be managed with proper care and lifestyle changes.

🌡️ 5. Illness or Infection
Short-term illnesses (flu, malaria, typhoid) cause temporary hormonal changes.
Delays are usually temporary; cycle resets once you recover.

🕯️ 6. Change in Routine or Environment
Travel, relocation, lack of sleep, or shift in daily habits throws off circadian rhythm.
Your period might skip a few days or even a week.
Example: Travel to different time zone or moving schools.

💊 7. Birth Control or Medications
Starting/stopping birth control pills, injections, or implants causes delays as body adjusts.
Other medicines (depression meds, thyroid meds) also affect cycle.
Usually balances out after 1-3 months.

⏳ 8. Puberty or Perimenopause
First period: body is still figuring things out; normal for cycles to be irregular for 1-2 years.
Later in life: approaching menopause, periods become irregular again.
Example: 13-year-old might skip a month then have heavy flow next—part of body learning.

👧 9. Nutrient Deficiencies
Low iron, vitamin D, or B vitamins interfere with hormone production.
These nutrients control signals telling body when to release eggs.
Tip: Eat balanced meals—fruits, vegetables, beans, eggs, fish, lots of water.

😴 10. Sleep Problems
Poor sleep or staying up late affects melatonin, which disrupts estrogen/progesterone balance.
Tip: Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep daily.

💕 11. Pregnancy
If unprotected sex occurred and period is late, pregnancy is one reason.
Body didn't shed lining because baby might be growing.
Note: Check safely with test or health worker if unsure. Better to know early than stress silently.

🌻 Key Takeaway
A late period doesn't always mean something is wrong. Sometimes it's just your body saying "I need a little break."

MYTHS vs TRUTH

Myth: Tampons remove virginity
Truth: Tampons don't remove virginity. Virginity is a social concept, not a medical state. Inserting a tampon is not sex.

Myth: Periods make you "dirty"
Truth: Menstruation is a natural biological process. The blood is clean and healthy. Periods don't make you unhygienic.

Myth: You can't get pregnant during your period
Truth: Pregnancy is possible during menstruation, especially with irregular cycles. Use protection if you don't want pregnancy.

Myth: You can't do anything during your period
Truth: You can exercise, work, study, play, and live fully during your period. Rest when needed, but don't stop living.

Myth: Period blood is different from regular blood
Truth: Menstrual blood contains blood, tissue from uterine lining, and cervical mucus. It's slightly different in composition but not "bad."

Myth: Heavy periods are normal
Truth: Heavy periods lasting 7+ days or requiring hourly pad changes may signal a condition. Consult a doctor if flow is unusually heavy.

Myth: Sex during period is "dirty"
Truth: You can have sex during your period. Use protection to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Some couples choose not to; that's personal preference.

Myth: Only women menstruate
Truth: Trans men and non-binary people also menstruate. Use inclusive language.

Myth: Periods are a punishment
Truth: Periods are a natural part of the reproductive cycle. They're not punishment; they're biology.

Myth: You should hide your period
Truth: Periods are normal. You don't need to hide pads, tampons, or talk about your cycle. Openness reduces stigma.
